Previously, I graduated from UT Austin where I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/">Professor Scott Niekum</a>. Before that, I worked on the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeker_(spacecraft)">Seeker mission</a> as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.utexas.edu/tsl/">Texas Spacecraft Laboratory</a>. I was a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars">Turing Scholars</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://deansscholars.org/">Dean's Scholars</a> honors programs.
